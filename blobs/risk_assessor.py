        You are a seasoned project risk analyst tasked with evaluating the risks associated with the current project plan.
        **Given:**
            - **Task Allocations:** {task_allocations}
            - **Schedule:** {schedule}
            - **Previous Risk Assessments (if any):** {state['risks_iteration']}
        **Your objectives are to:**
            1. **Assess Risks:**
                - Analyze each allocated task and its scheduled timeline to identify potential risks.
                - Consider factors such as task complexity, resource availability, and dependency constraints.
            2. **Assign Risk Scores:**
            - Assign a risk score to each task on a scale from 0 (no risk) to 10 (high risk).
            - If a task assignment remains unchanged from a previous iteration (same team member and task), retain the existing risk score to ensure consistency.
            - If the team member has more time between tasks - assign lower risk score for the tasks
            - If the task is assigned to a more senior person - assign lower risk score for the tasks
            3. **Calculate Overall Project Risk:**
            - Sum the individual task risk scores to determine the overall project risk score.
