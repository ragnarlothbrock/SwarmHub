# /daemon -- Continuous Autonomous Operation

Architecture, daemon.json field reference, and rationale: docs/DAEMON.md.

## Orientation

**Use when:** running campaigns overnight or unattended -- chains sessions automatically until a ceiling or budget is hit.
**Don't use when:** a single autonomous session is enough (use /archon); you want manual control between cycles (use /loop).

## Default execution path (READ FIRST)

**`/daemon start` does NOT call `RemoteTrigger` by default.** The local runner is the default. Only pass `--remote` to use Anthropic's routine system, and only after explicit user confirmation.

**Why:** `RemoteTrigger` counts against the account-wide **15 routine runs / 24h** cap. A single overnight run can exhaust the quota and pause every other routine on the account (including unrelated ones). See [docs/ROUTINE-QUOTA.md](../../docs/ROUTINE-QUOTA.md).

### Default flow — `/daemon start` (no `--remote` flag)

1. Do Steps 1, 2, and 4 below (validate, check existing, write `daemon.json`).
2. **Skip Step 3** — do NOT create any `RemoteTrigger`. Leave `chainTriggerId` and `watchdogTriggerId` as `null` in the state file.
3. Instead of Step 5's trigger-confirmation, output the local-runner instructions (full text: docs/DAEMON.md#local-runner-default): the state file path, campaign, and budget, then:
   ```
   To start the tick loop, run in a separate terminal:
     npm run daemon:local

   Leave that terminal open. It spawns `claude -p "/do continue"` each
   session, respects daemon.json status, and consumes zero Anthropic
   routine quota. Stop with Ctrl+C or `/daemon stop`.

   For true unattended background operation (machine sleeps, user away):
     /daemon start --remote    (uses RemoteTrigger, counts against 15/day cap)
   ```

### Codex automation lane

In Codex, prefer a Codex Automation for durable unattended daemon ticks when available: `node scripts/codex-automation.js plan --type daemon --command "/daemon tick" --cadence "<interval>" --target background-worktree --write`. Use the returned prompt in the Codex app automation surface. Each run must still read and update `.planning/daemon.json`; Codex owns the scheduling, Citadel owns the budget/status gates and run log.

### Opt-in routine flow — `/daemon start --remote`

Only when the user has explicitly passed `--remote`:
1. Before proceeding, confirm: "This will use Anthropic's `RemoteTrigger`, which counts against your 15 routine runs / 24h quota. A single overnight daemon can exhaust it. Continue? (y/N)"
2. If the user confirms, run the full Step 1-5 protocol below (including Step 3's trigger creation).

## Commands

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/daemon start` | Default: create state file, prompt user to run `npm run daemon:local` (zero routine cost) |
| `/daemon start --remote` | Use `RemoteTrigger` instead (counts against 15/day routine quota — requires confirmation) |
| `/daemon start --campaign {slug}` | Target a specific campaign |
| `/daemon start --budget {N}` | Set budget cap in dollars (default: $50) |
| `/daemon start --budget unlimited` | Explicitly disable budget cap |
| `/daemon start --interval {N}m` | Set watchdog interval (default: 30m) |
| `/daemon start --cooldown {N}s` | Set delay between sessions (default: 60s) |
| `/daemon start --cost-per-session {N}` | Override per-session cost estimate (default: $3) |
| `/daemon stop` | Stop the daemon, tear down triggers |
| `/daemon status` | Show daemon state, session count, budget remaining |
| `/daemon log` | Show recent daemon session history |
| `/daemon tick` | Internal: heartbeat handler fired by triggers. Not user-facing. |

## Protocol

### /daemon start

**Step 1: Validate prerequisites**

1. Check `.planning/` exists. If not: "No planning directory found. Run `/do setup` first."
2. Find the target campaign: if `--campaign {slug}` provided, read `.planning/campaigns/{slug}.md`; otherwise scan `.planning/campaigns/` (excluding `completed/`) for files with `status: active` in frontmatter. No active campaign → "No active campaign. Start one with `/archon` first." Multiple active and no flag → list them, ask user to specify.
3. Verify the campaign has a Continuation State section (Archon knows where to resume)
4. Parse budget: default `$50`. `--budget unlimited` → set budget to `Infinity`, warn: "No budget cap. You will not be protected from runaway costs. Monitor usage at your Anthropic dashboard." `--budget {N}` → parse as number, must be > 0.
5. Parse cost-per-session: `--cost-per-session {N}` if provided; else the campaign's `estimated_cost_per_loop` frontmatter field if present (improve campaigns set this to 12); otherwise default `$3`. The auto-read prevents running an improve campaign on the $3 default designed for simple archon sessions (rationale: docs/DAEMON.md#cost-estimation).

**Step 2: Check for existing daemon**

Read `.planning/daemon.json` if it exists. If a daemon is already running (`status: "running"`): show its state (campaign, sessions completed, budget remaining) and ask "A daemon is already running. Stop it and start a new one?" Yes → run `/daemon stop` first, then continue. No → abort.

**Step 3: Create triggers** (remote flow only)

**A. Chain trigger** — one-shot, fires after cooldown, `command: "/daemon tick"`. Save ID as `chainTriggerId`.
**B. Watchdog trigger** — recurring, fires every `--interval`, `command: "/daemon tick --watchdog"`. Save ID as `watchdogTriggerId`.
Both use `type: scheduled/recurring`, `project_path: {absolute project root}`, `description: "Daemon: {slug} tick/watchdog"`.

**Step 4: Write state file**

Write `.planning/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "campaignSlug": "{slug}",
  "budget": 50,
  "costPerSession": 3,
  "estimatedSpend": 0,
  "sessionCount": 0,
  "interval": "30m",
  "cooldown": "60s",
  "chainTriggerId": "{id from step 3A}",
  "watchdogTriggerId": "{id from step 3B}",
  "startedAt": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "lastTickAt": null,
  "lastTickStatus": null,
  "stoppedAt": null,
  "stopReason": null,
  "log": []
}
```

**Step 5: Log and confirm**

Log `daemon-start` event with budget and interval. Output confirmation: campaign slug, budget (estimated sessions), cooldown, watchdog interval, state file path. Suggest `/daemon status` and `/daemon stop`.

### /daemon stop

1. Read `.planning/daemon.json`. If missing or not `running`: "No daemon is running."
2. Delete both triggers (ignore failures — may already be cleaned up).
3. Update daemon.json: `status: stopped`, `stoppedAt`, `stopReason: user`.
4. Log `daemon-stop` event. Output: sessions completed, estimated spend, campaign status.

### /daemon status

Output: status, campaign (slug + phase), sessions, budget (spent/cap/remaining), cost/session source, last tick (time + status), running duration, watchdog interval, state file path.

If `paused-level-up`: add instructions to review proposals at `.planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md` and set campaign `status: active` to resume. For improve campaigns: add loops completed/total, current level, last axis attacked.

### /daemon log

Read `.planning/daemon.json` and output the `log` array, most recent first, as `[{timestamp}] Session #{N}: {status} -- {summary}` with a second line `Phase: {phase} | Duration: {duration} | Est. cost: ${cost}` (entry format: docs/DAEMON.md#daemonjson-reference). Show the last 20 entries. If more exist: "Showing last 20 of {total}. Full log in .planning/daemon.json"

### /daemon tick

**This is the heartbeat handler. It runs in a fresh Claude Code session spawned by the scheduler. It is not user-facing.**

**Step 1: Gate checks**

1. Read `.planning/daemon.json`
2. **Status gate**: If status is not `"running"` and not `"paused-level-up"` -- exit silently. The daemon was stopped. If `"paused-level-up"`: read the campaign file. If campaign status is now `active` (human approved the level-up): update daemon.json `status: "running"`, clear `pauseReason`, log `daemon-resume` with reason `level-up-approved`, continue to Step 2. If still `level-up-pending`: exit silently (still waiting for human).
3. **Lock gate**: If `lastTickAt` is within the last 2 minutes and `lastTickStatus` is `"running"` -- another session is active. Exit silently.
4. **Budget gate**: If `estimatedSpend >= budget` -- stop the daemon: update daemon.json (`status: "stopped"`, `stopReason: "budget-exhausted"`), delete both triggers, log `daemon-stop` with reason `budget-exhausted`, exit.
5. **Campaign gate**: Read the campaign file.
   - File does not exist, or `status: completed`, `failed`, or `parked` -- stop the daemon: update daemon.json (`status: "stopped"`, `stopReason:` `"no-active-work"` for a missing file, `"campaign-completed"` / `"campaign-failed"` / `"campaign-parked"` for the matching status), delete both triggers, log `daemon-stop` with that reason, exit.
   - `status: level-up-pending` -- **pause** the daemon (do not stop): update daemon.json `status: "paused-level-up"`, `pauseReason: "Improve hit distribution saturation. Human approval required for level-up proposals."` Do NOT delete triggers (the watchdog stays alive to detect when the human resumes). Log `daemon-pause` with reason `level-up-pending`. Append to daemon.json log: `"Paused: level-up triggered. Approve proposals at .planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md and set campaign status to active to resume."` Exit.

**Step 2: Acquire lock**

Update daemon.json: `lastTickAt` = current ISO timestamp, `lastTickStatus: "running"`.

**Step 3: Execute**

Run `/do continue` -- routes to Archon, which reads the campaign's Continuation State and picks up where the last session left off. Archon works until the current phase completes (normal exit), context runs low and PreCompact fires (saves state, session can end), or an error parks the campaign.

**Step 4: Record session**

After `/do continue` returns (or the session is winding down):

1. Read the campaign file again to get updated status and phase
2. **No-work gate**: If the campaign status is `completed`, `failed`, `parked`, or the campaign file no longer exists -- stop the daemon immediately: update daemon.json (`status: "stopped"`, `stopReason: "no-active-work"`, `stoppedAt: "{ISO timestamp}"`), delete both triggers, log `daemon-stop` with reason `no-active-work`. Do NOT schedule the next tick. Exit after recording the session.
3. Update daemon.json: increment `sessionCount`, add `costPerSession` to `estimatedSpend`, set `lastTickStatus: "completed"`, append a `log` entry with session, timestamp, status, phase, summary, and estimatedCost (JSON shape: docs/DAEMON.md#daemonjson-reference).
4. Run a safe memory consolidation pass when the session produced planning changes: `node scripts/memory-compile.js compile`. If it fails, record the failure in daemon.json `log` and continue shutdown or scheduling; memory compile failures must not create overlapping daemon ticks.

**Step 5: Schedule next tick**

Re-read daemon.json. If still `running` and `estimatedSpend + costPerSession <= budget`: create new chain trigger (one-shot, cooldown delay), update `chainTriggerId`. If budget would be exceeded: stop daemon (`budget-exhausted`), delete watchdog, log `daemon-stop`.

**Step 6: Exit**

Session ends cleanly. PreCompact hook saves campaign state. The next tick starts a fresh session with full context budget.

### /daemon tick --watchdog

Same as `/daemon tick` but after the standard gate checks pass, check whether the chain is alive: read `lastTickAt` from daemon.json.
- If `lastTickAt` is more than `2 * interval` ago AND `lastTickStatus` is not `"running"`: the chain died. Log: `"Watchdog: chain appears dead. Last tick at {lastTickAt}. Restarting chain."` Proceed with Step 2 onwards (this watchdog tick becomes a chain tick) and schedule the next chain tick in Step 5.
- If `lastTickAt` is recent (within `2 * interval`): the chain is healthy. Exit silently.

## SessionStart Hook Bridge (Primary Bootstrap)

The daemon's primary continuation mechanism is the `init-project.js` SessionStart hook, not RemoteTrigger prompt injection. On every session start the hook reads `.planning/daemon.json`; if `status: running`, it checks the lock (no overlap), budget (can afford), and campaign (still active), and when all gates pass outputs `[daemon] Active daemon detected. Campaign: {slug}. Run: /do continue` — the agent sees this first and executes `/do continue`. RemoteTrigger's role is reduced to scheduling session starts; if it is unavailable, an OS cron job or manual restart achieves the same result (architecture: docs/DAEMON.md#how-it-works).

## Budget Tracking

**Primary:** Read latest entry from `.planning/telemetry/session-costs.jsonl` (written by session-end hook) for real cost. Use `override_cost` if present, else `estimated_cost`.

**Fallback:** `costPerSession` flat estimate (default $3). Each tick adds it to `estimatedSpend`.

Stop when `estimatedSpend >= budget` or `estimatedSpend + costPerSession > budget` (preemptive). Overrides: `--budget {N}` | `--budget unlimited` (explicit, warns) | `--cost-per-session {N}`

## Fringe Cases

- **RemoteTrigger unavailable**: SessionStart hook bridge still works. Suggest OS cron: `*/30 * * * * cd ~/project && claude -p '/do continue'`
- **No `.planning/`**: "Run `/do setup` first."
- **Campaign has no Continuation State**: run `/archon` once interactively to establish it.
- **daemon.json corrupted**: treat as no daemon running; `/daemon start` fresh.
- **Session crashes without next tick**: watchdog restarts chain after `2 * interval`.
- **Multiple daemons**: one per project. Block with "daemon already running" prompt.
- **`/daemon tick` called manually**: works, gate checks apply. Warn it's internal.
- **Budget exhausted**: stop, log "Budget exhausted. Restart with `--budget {higher}`."
- **Level-up during run**: detect `level-up-pending`, set `paused-level-up`, keep watchdog alive for human-resume detection.
- **Campaign completes mid-session**: no-work gate (Step 4) catches it, stops daemon.
- **Idle loop bug (campaign done but daemon still running)**: three layers prevent it — campaign gate (Step 1), no-work gate (Step 4), `/do` Tier 1 stop. All write `stopReason: no-active-work`.

## Contextual Gates

### Disclosure
Always disclose, regardless of trust level:
- "Starting continuous mode on campaign {slug}. Budget: ${N} (~{sessions} sessions at ${cost}/session). Sessions restart automatically until done or budget exhausted."
- For unlimited budget: "WARNING: No budget cap. Sessions will continue until the campaign completes or you run `/daemon stop`."

### Reversibility
- **Amber:** Standard daemon with budget cap -- stop with `/daemon stop`, no work is lost
- **Red:** Daemon with `--budget unlimited` -- no automatic cost protection

Red actions (unlimited budget) require explicit confirmation at ALL trust levels.

### Proportionality
Before starting, verify daemon is warranted:
- If campaign has only 1 remaining phase: suggest running it directly instead
- If estimated sessions <= 2: suggest manual continuation instead
- If campaign is type `improve` and no rubric exists: block -- rubric requires human approval first

### Trust Gating
Read trust level from `harness.json`:
- **Novice** (0-4 sessions): Block daemon activation entirely. Output: "Daemon mode requires familiarity with the harness. Complete a few sessions first, then daemon will be available."
- **Familiar** (5-19 sessions): Allow with full disclosure and explicit confirmation.
- **Trusted** (20+ sessions): Allow with cost-only confirmation.

## Quality Gates

- Budget cap MUST be set (default $50, explicit `unlimited` to bypass)
- Daemon state file MUST be written before any triggers are created
- Both triggers (chain + watchdog) must be created; if either fails, abort and clean up
- Every tick must update daemon.json BEFORE scheduling the next tick
- Campaign must have Continuation State before daemon can start
- Lock mechanism must prevent overlapping sessions
- Watchdog must detect and recover from dead chains
- Stop must clean up ALL triggers (no orphaned triggers)

## Exit Protocol

- `start`: confirmation output, no HANDOFF
- `stop`: stop summary, no HANDOFF
- `tick`: no user output (headless); updates daemon.json, schedules or stops
- `status`/`log`: output requested info
- On error: actionable message, clean up any dangling triggers before exiting
