# Contributing to AI Real Estate Assistant

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-real-estate-assistant.git`
3. Run setup: `make setup` (or `make install` for dependencies only)
4. Start developing: `make dev`

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd apps/api
uv sync                    # Install Python dependencies
cp ../../.env.example ../../.env  # Configure environment
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd apps/web
npm ci                     # Install Node dependencies
cp .env.example .env.local # Configure environment
```

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)

- **Formatter**: Ruff (line-length: 100, target: Python 3.12)
- **Type hints**: Required for all function signatures
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports from project root

```bash
cd apps/api && ruff check .     # Lint
cd apps/api && ruff format .    # Format
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- **Linter**: ESLint
- **Formatter**: Prettier (via lint-staged)

```bash
cd apps/web && npm run lint     # Lint
```

## Testing

### Backend

```bash
cd apps/api
pytest tests/unit tests/integration --cov=. -n auto  # All tests with coverage
pytest tests/unit/test_query_analyzer.py -v          # Single file
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
npm test               # All tests
npm run test:ci        # CI with coverage
```

## Commit Convention

Format: `type(scope): description (Task #XX)`

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New features |
| `fix` | Bug fixes |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring |
| `test` | Test additions/changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance, CI, tooling |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes |

## Community Edition (CE) Contributions

This project offers a **Community Edition** that is open-source and welcomes contributions. Some features are reserved for paid editions (Pro, Enterprise) as noted in the MCP connector allowlist.

### CE-Compatible Contributions

Contributions are CE-compatible when they:

- Do not introduce Pro/Enterprise-only features into CE code paths
- Use edition-gated patterns (see `apps/api/mcp/config/mcp_allowlist.yaml`)
- Include tests that run without paid API keys
- Do not require proprietary data or services

### Edition Access Control

Connectors and features use an edition-based allowlist:

| Edition | Available Connectors |
|---------|---------------------|
| Community (CE) | echo_stub, google_maps, openstreetmap, web_scraper |
| Pro | + salesforce, stripe, hubspot |
| Enterprise | + slack, custom connectors |

When adding a new connector, add it to the appropriate section in `mcp/config/mcp_allowlist.yaml`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `dev`: `git checkout -b feature/short-description`
2. Make your changes with tests
3. Run `make lint` and `make test` to verify
4. Push and open a PR against `dev`
5. Ensure CI passes (linting, tests, security scans)

### MCP Connector Pattern

Community connectors follow the `MCPConnector[T]` abstract base class:

1. Extend `MCPConnector` from `apps/api/mcp/base.py`
2. Implement required methods: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `health_check()`, `execute()`
3. Register in `apps/api/mcp/registry.py`
4. Add to `apps/api/config/mcp_allowlist.yaml` under `community_edition`
5. Add tests in `apps/api/tests/unit/mcp/`

Reference implementation: `apps/api/mcp/connectors/web_scraper.py`
