CMA adjustment calculations for property valuation.

This module implements adjustment calculations for Comparative Market Analysis,
accounting for differences between subject and comparable properties.

Adjustment categories:
1. Location - District price indices and neighborhood premiums
2. Size - Price per sqm scaling for area differences
3. Age - Depreciation/appreciation based on year built
4. Condition - Energy rating and overall condition
5. Amenities - Individual amenity premiums/discounts
6. Floor - Ground floor penalty, top floor premium
7. Market conditions - Time-based price adjustments

Based on HedonicValuationModel coefficients from analytics/valuation_model.py
