# Post-Test Checklist

## After Tests Complete

### 1. Record Performance Metrics

- [ ] Note total test execution time
- [ ] Count number of tests executed
- [ ] Record any failures or errors
- [ ] Calculate speedup vs sequential execution

**Template:**
```markdown
### Test Run Results (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Environment:** Local / CI
**Python Version:** 3.12.x
**CPU Cores:** X
**Workers:** auto / X

**Results:**
- Total Tests: X,XXX
- Passed: X,XXX
- Failed: X
- Skipped: X
- Duration: XXm XXs
- Speedup: Xx (vs sequential)

**Notes:**
- Any issues observed
- Performance bottlenecks
- Recommendations
```

### 2. Update Documentation

- [ ] Update `TEST_OPTIMIZATION.md` with actual performance numbers
- [ ] Update `PARALLEL_TESTING_SUMMARY.md` with results
- [ ] Add performance comparison table
- [ ] Document any issues found

**Files to Update:**
- `docs/testing/TEST_OPTIMIZATION.md` → "Expected Results" section
- `docs/testing/PARALLEL_TESTING_SUMMARY.md` → "Performance Results" section

### 3. Verify Test Atomicity

- [ ] All tests passed in parallel
- [ ] No race conditions detected
- [ ] Results consistent across runs
- [ ] No flaky tests observed

**If issues found:**
1. Identify problematic tests
2. Check for shared state
3. Fix isolation issues
4. Re-run tests

### 4. Test the New Scripts

- [ ] Test `scripts/run_ci_tests_local.ps1` on Windows
- [ ] Test `scripts/run_ci_tests_local.sh` on Linux/macOS
- [ ] Verify all options work (`-Fast`, `-Coverage`, etc.)
- [ ] Check error handling

**Commands to Test:**
```powershell
# Windows
.\scripts\run_ci_tests_local.ps1
.\scripts\run_ci_tests_local.ps1 -Fast
.\scripts\run_ci_tests_local.ps1 -Coverage
.\scripts\run_ci_tests_local.ps1 -Parallel:$false
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./scripts/run_ci_tests_local.sh
./scripts/run_ci_tests_local.sh --fast
./scripts/run_ci_tests_local.sh --coverage
./scripts/run_ci_tests_local.sh --no-parallel
```

### 5. Test CI Workflow (Optional)

- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Push changes
- [ ] Trigger CI workflow
- [ ] Compare execution time with baseline
- [ ] Verify all jobs pass

**Workflows to Test:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (existing with pytest-xdist)
- `.github/workflows/ci-parallel.yml` (new matrix strategy)

### 6. Commit Changes

```
feat: implement parallel test execution for faster CI/CD

- Add pytest-xdist for local parallel execution
- Create GitHub Actions matrix strategy for CI
- Add unified test scripts for Windows/Linux/macOS
- Fix OpenAPI diff to include JWT-protected endpoints
- Update documentation with performance results

Performance improvements:
- Local: XXm XXs → XXm XXs (Xx speedup)
- CI: XXm XXs → XXm XXs (Xx speedup)

All tests verified as atomic and independent.
No race conditions detected.

Closes #XXX
```

### 7. Performance Comparison

Create a comparison table:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Local (sequential) | XXm XXs | - | Baseline |
| Local (parallel) | - | XXm XXs | Xx faster |
| CI (sequential) | XXm XXs | - | Baseline |
| CI (pytest-xdist) | - | XXm XXs | Xx faster |
| CI (matrix) | - | XXm XXs | Xx faster |

### 8. Identify Bottlenecks

- [ ] Run `pytest --durations=20` to find slowest tests
- [ ] Document slow tests
- [ ] Create issues for optimization
- [ ] Add `@pytest.mark.slow` markers

**Command:**
```bash
cd apps/api
pytest tests/unit --durations=20 -n auto
```

### 9. Update Project README

- [ ] Add section about running tests
- [ ] Link to test documentation
- [ ] Mention parallel execution
- [ ] Add performance metrics

**Suggested Section:**
```markdown
## Testing

### Quick Start

Run the complete CI test suite locally:

```bash
# Windows
.\scripts\run_ci_tests_local.ps1

# Linux/macOS
./scripts/run_ci_tests_local.sh
```

### Performance

- **6,254+ tests** run in parallel
- **Local execution**: ~Xm (Xx faster than sequential)
- **CI execution**: ~Xm (Xx faster than sequential)

See [Test Optimization Guide](docs/testing/TEST_OPTIMIZATION.md) for details.
```

### 10. Create GitHub Issue/PR

- [ ] Create PR with changes
- [ ] Link to performance results
- [ ] Request review
- [ ] Update project board

**PR Template:**
```markdown
