"""Backend factory — HTTP-transport sandbox builder.

The agent code shouldn't know how the sandbox is deployed; it just asks
for a sandbox object. ``build_sandbox_backend()`` returns an
``HTTPSandbox`` that talks to a sandbox daemon over HTTP, which works in
every deployment target Decepticon supports today:

  - Dev / local-docker: sandbox container exposes the FastAPI daemon
    on ``http://sandbox:9999`` over the shared ``sandbox-net`` network.
  - GCE Spot VMs (SaaS silo plane): sandbox sibling container on the VM,
    daemon reachable on loopback.
  - Cloud Run (SaaS pool plane): sandbox runs as a sidecar in the same
    Cloud Run revision, reachable on ``localhost:9999`` via the shared
    network namespace.

There is no longer a docker-exec transport: the previous DockerSandbox
path required mounting ``/var/run/docker.sock`` into the langgraph
container, which is a host-escape vector for any prompt-injection-driven
RCE inside the agent process. HTTP-only consolidates on a single tested
code path and keeps the sandbox blast radius bounded by the container
boundary + the ``sandbox-net`` network.

# ``configurable.sandbox_url`` — see ``tools/bash/bash.py:_sandbox_from_config``)
# to its OWN per-engagement sandbox. Each must keep its own client so the
# ``SandboxNotificationMiddleware._jobs`` view stays consistent within a run;
# under-sizing would evict a live engagement's client mid-flight. 128 covers
# realistic per-process concurrency with headroom.

    """Build the HTTP-transport sandbox backend.

    Returns the same ``HTTPSandbox`` instance for every call with the
    same ``(base_url, token)``. langgraph dev server invokes one factory
    per registered graph at startup; without a shared client each
    factory builds its own client + its own ``BackgroundJobTracker``,
    and the ``SandboxNotificationMiddleware`` instance held by each
    graph sees a different ``_jobs`` view than the bash tool actually
    registers against — completion notifications never reach the agent.
    Keying by ``(base_url, token)`` keeps tests that monkeypatch the env
    isolated and supports multi-tenant SaaS deployments where pools
    target distinct daemons.

        SAAS_SANDBOX_TOKEN
            Optional bearer token for daemon auth — recommended even on
            loopback as defence-in-depth.
