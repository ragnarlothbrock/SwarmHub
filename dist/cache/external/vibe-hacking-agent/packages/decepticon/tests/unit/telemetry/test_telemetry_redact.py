"""Tests for decepticon.telemetry.redact — the identifier masking engine.

Safety-critical: the whole research corpus depends on these never leaking a real
target. The corpus is a realistic reasoning blob; the assertion is twofold —
NOTHING identifying survives, and the reasoning STRUCTURE (stable placeholders)
does survive.
