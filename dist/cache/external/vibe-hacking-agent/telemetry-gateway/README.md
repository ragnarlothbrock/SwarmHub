# Decepticon Telemetry Gateway (PoC)

The public, unauthenticated **ingest gateway** for OSS maintainer telemetry —
Layer 1 of [`docs/design/2026-06-20-telemetry-data-collection-design.md`](../docs/design/2026-06-20-telemetry-data-collection-design.md).

A Cloudflare Worker that sits between many OSS clients and the maintainer's
analytics backend. It exists to enforce the privacy invariants a SaaS backend
cannot, and to hold the backend secret so the OSS client never has to.

> **PoC status.** Working, tested gateway (schema + Tier-C scanner + PostHog
> forward + rate-limit) **plus** a Python client that emits to it: consent
> resolution, sanitizer, batch exporter, and a sink wired into
> `EventLogMiddleware` (`packages/decepticon/decepticon/telemetry/`), the
> `decepticon-cli telemetry` subcommand, and `TELEMETRY.md`. Remaining: MITRE
> tagging at the agent layer (the heatmap source) and production hardening.

## Why a gateway (and not client → SaaS directly)

OSS can't ship a write credential — embedding a backend key is a key-leak. The
gateway is the standard fix: the client learns only the public Worker URL; the
gateway holds the secret and forwards server-side. It also lets us:

| Invariant | How the gateway enforces it |
|---|---|
| **Drop client IP** | The user's IP is invisible to PostHog (the *gateway* is the connecting client); we also set `$geoip_disable`. IP is used only transiently as a rate-limit key, never stored or forwarded. |
| **Tier-C never leaks** | Fail-closed content scan (`src/tierc.ts`): if a client bug lets a raw IP / cred / host through, the **whole batch is rejected (422)** — the matched value is never echoed or logged. |
| **Off-contract data dropped** | Strict Zod schema (`src/schema.ts`): unknown envelope/event keys are rejected (400). The schema is a closed allow-list of non-identifying scalar/enum fields. |
| **Abuse cap** | Per-`install_id` rate limit on a public endpoint. |

This mirrors Stacklok ToolHive's design (a security tool with the same threat
model): a maintainer collector receiving only anonymous, identifier-stripped
counts.

## Data flow

```
Decepticon client (URL only, no secret)
   │  POST /v1/telemetry   { Tier-A batch, batched + gzipped }
   ▼
Cloudflare Worker (this)
   │  1. method/size/content-type guards
   │  2. Zod schema validation        → 400
   │  3. Tier-C fail-closed scan       → 422  (never echo the value)
   │  4. rate-limit (install_id+IP)    → 429
   │  5. forward (server-side key)
   ▼
PostHog  /batch/   (funnels, distributions, ATT&CK heatmap — §5 outputs)
```

## Layout

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/schema.ts` | **Canonical Tier-A contract** (Zod). Runtime ingest validation. |
| `schema.json` | Language-neutral mirror (JSON Schema) — the Python client validates against this. Keep in sync with `schema.ts`. |
| `src/tierc.ts` | Fail-closed forbidden-content scanner (IPv4/6, email, URL, host, AWS key, JWT, MAC, user:pass, private key, opaque blob). |
| `src/posthog.ts` | Forwarder to PostHog `/batch/` with privacy hardening. |
| `src/index.ts` | Worker `fetch` handler wiring the pipeline. |
| `test/` | vitest: Tier-C corpus (§9.1 "no leak" gate), schema contract, full handler. |

## Develop & test

```bash
cd telemetry-gateway
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run dev          # local Worker at http://localhost:8787
```

## Deploy (maintainer-side)

```bash
npx wrangler secret put POSTHOG_KEY   # PostHog project key — server-only secret
npx wrangler deploy
```

Cost: Cloudflare free tier (100k req/day, scale-to-zero) + PostHog free tier
(1M events/mo) = **$0**. The Worker abstracts the backend, so a later fan-out to
ClickHouse/Grafana needs no client change.

## Schema ↔ contract sync

`src/schema.ts` (Zod) and `schema.json` (JSON Schema) describe the **same** wire
format. `schema.ts` is authoritative for ingest; `schema.json` is what the
Python client should validate against before sending. When you change one,
change the other (a generator can replace the hand-mirror later).

## Next steps (not in this PoC)

1. Python client emitter — reuse `event_log.py` shapes, POST Tier-A batches.
2. Consent CLI — `decepticon telemetry status|off|preview`, honor `DO_NOT_TRACK`.
3. `TELEMETRY.md` — every field, the redaction rules, the endpoint.
4. Tier-B classification/redaction behind `extended` consent.
