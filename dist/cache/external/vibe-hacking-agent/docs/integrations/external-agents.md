# External agents — OpenClaw & Hermes

Decepticon ships an **engagement MCP server** so external agent runtimes can
drive it like its CLI — from a phone, via those agents' chat channels. It
exposes the full interactive loop over the Model Context Protocol: discover and
resume engagements, launch one, **steer it by chatting**, **watch progress**,
inspect the OPPLAN, and pull findings.

This makes Decepticon usable from
[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and
[Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

```
OpenClaw / Hermes  ──MCP──▶  decepticon-mcp  ──LangGraph SDK──▶  Decepticon server
   (chat / phone)              (bridge)         (HTTP :2024)        (16 agents, RoE, KG)
```

The bridge is a thin control plane. The red-team work runs inside the
Decepticon LangGraph server (full RoE enforcement, sandbox, knowledge-graph
persistence); the MCP layer translates tool calls into LangGraph runs
(`decepticon.mcp_server`) and reads persisted transcript/state/findings back.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `decepticon_list_graphs` | Discover engagement graphs (decepticon, recon, soundwave, …) |
| `decepticon_list_engagements` | Browse / resume recent engagements |
| `decepticon_start_engagement` | Launch a background engagement (targets + scope/RoE) |
| `decepticon_send_message` | Steer / answer the coordinator / `/model` switch mid-run |
| `decepticon_transcript` | Read the orchestrator narrative incrementally (watch) |
| `decepticon_watch` | Tail the live sub-agent stream for a few seconds |
| `decepticon_engagement_state` | Inspect OPPLAN / objectives / scope / phase |
| `decepticon_engagement_status` | Latest run status + whether findings exist |
| `decepticon_engagement_findings` | Findings summary / full SARIF v2.1.0 |
| `decepticon_cancel_engagement` | Stop the active run |

Every tool is keyed by the `thread_id` returned from `decepticon_start_engagement`
(or listed by `decepticon_list_engagements`) — no run-id juggling, just like the CLI.

## 1. Install + run

```bash
# Install Decepticon with the MCP server extra
pip install 'decepticon[mcp]'        # or: uv sync --extra mcp

# Start the Decepticon LangGraph server (one of):
langgraph dev                        # dev server on http://localhost:2024
# or the Docker stack — see docs/deployment

# Smoke-test the bridge over stdio (Ctrl-C to exit):
DECEPTICON_SKIP_BOOT=1 decepticon-mcp --transport stdio
```

> **`DECEPTICON_SKIP_BOOT=1`** — always set this for the bridge. It drives a
> *separate* LangGraph server and never builds agents in-process, so the eager
> framework boot is pure cold-start overhead. With it, the server starts in a
> few seconds instead of ~30s; the wiring below sets it for you. It does **not**
> weaken Rules-of-Engagement: RoE is enforced inside the LangGraph server the
> bridge talks to, not in this process, so skipping the in-process boot leaves
> scope enforcement untouched.

The bridge connects to `DECEPTICON_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:2024`).
Override with `--langgraph-url` or the env var.

## 2. OpenClaw

```bash
# Register the engagement MCP server (stdio)
openclaw mcp set decepticon '{
  "command": "decepticon-mcp",
  "args": ["--transport", "stdio"],
  "env": { "DECEPTICON_API_URL": "http://localhost:2024", "DECEPTICON_SKIP_BOOT": "1" }
}'

# Install the agent skill (clone the repo first, then point at the skill dir)
openclaw skills install ./Decepticon/integrations/agent-skills/decepticon --as decepticon --global
openclaw gateway restart
```

Now message your OpenClaw agent (dashboard or any connected channel, e.g.
Telegram for phone): *"Start a Decepticon recon engagement against
`https://test.example.com` — scope only that host — then watch it and summarise
findings."* The agent calls `decepticon_start_engagement`, polls
`decepticon_transcript`, and reports findings.

## 3. Hermes

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
mcp_servers:
  decepticon:
    command: decepticon-mcp
    args: ["--transport", "stdio"]
    env:
      DECEPTICON_API_URL: "http://localhost:2024"
      DECEPTICON_SKIP_BOOT: "1"
```

```bash
# Install the skill for Hermes (copy the skill folder into Hermes' skills dir)
cp -r ./Decepticon/integrations/agent-skills/decepticon ~/.hermes/skills/red-teaming/decepticon
```

Restart Hermes; the `decepticon` skill and `decepticon_*` tools become available.

### The bundled skill

The skill at `integrations/agent-skills/decepticon/` is one canonical AgentSkill
that loads in **both** OpenClaw and Hermes (same `SKILL.md` format), using
progressive disclosure so the always-loaded context stays lean:

- `SKILL.md` — the playbook (mental model, authorization, the core loop,
  polling cadence, result interpretation, error recovery).
- `reference.md` — exact params, defaults, clamps, and return schemas per tool.
- `examples.md` — worked end-to-end tool-call sequences (bug bounty from a
  phone, recon-only, steering, resume, live burst, failure handling).

Both install commands above copy the whole directory, so the reference files
come along automatically. OpenClaw installs it globally as `decepticon`; Hermes
auto-discovers it under the `red-teaming` category.

## 4. CLI-like workflow (what the agent does)

1. `decepticon_start_engagement(targets=[...], instruction="In scope: …; Out of scope: …")`
   → keep the `thread_id`.
2. `decepticon_transcript(thread_id, after_index=…)` — poll to narrate progress
   (operator prompts, coordinator replies, `task()` delegations to specialists).
   `decepticon_watch(thread_id)` tails the live sub-agent feed for a few seconds.
3. `decepticon_send_message(thread_id, "focus on the API, skip the marketing site")`
   — steer mid-engagement, answer the coordinator, or `/model anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`.
4. `decepticon_engagement_state(thread_id)` — check the OPPLAN / phase.
5. `decepticon_engagement_findings(engagement_name, include_sarif=true)` — pull results.
6. Later, `decepticon_list_engagements()` to resume any thread by `thread_id`.

## 5. Remote / networked use (optional)

The bridge can launch authorized engagements, so the `streamable-http`
transport **refuses to bind a non-loopback `--host` without authentication** —
a bare `--host 0.0.0.0` exits with an error unless one of the modes below is
configured. Auth is enforced by the MCP SDK's bearer backend (a missing or
invalid `Authorization: Bearer` token gets a 401 before any tool runs).

**Shared-secret (OSS / single operator).** The token is read only from the
environment, never from argv:

```bash
DECEPTICON_MCP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
DECEPTICON_SKIP_BOOT=1 decepticon-mcp --transport streamable-http \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765 --langgraph-url http://decepticon-host:2024
```

Clients send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

**JWT (OAuth 2.1 resource server — SaaS / shared deployments).** Validates the
bearer JWT's signature, `iss`, and `aud` against your identity provider's JWKS
(or a static public key via `--auth-public-key`). This is the posture the MCP
June-2025 spec prescribes for remote servers:

```bash
DECEPTICON_SKIP_BOOT=1 decepticon-mcp --transport streamable-http \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765 --langgraph-url http://decepticon-host:2024 \
  --issuer https://issuer.example.com --audience decepticon-mcp \
  --jwks-uri https://issuer.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json \
  --required-scope engage
```

Point the agent's MCP client at `http://<bridge-host>:8765/mcp`. Loopback
(`--host 127.0.0.1`) stays auth-free for local stdio-equivalent use.

## Authorization

Engagements run under Decepticon's Rules-of-Engagement enforcement. The calling
agent **must** pass scope (in / out of scope) in the `instruction` argument and
only target assets the operator is authorized to test. See the bundled
`integrations/agent-skills/decepticon/SKILL.md` for the agent-facing contract.
