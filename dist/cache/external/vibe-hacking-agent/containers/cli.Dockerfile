# Copy compiled output + runtime dependencies. We run plain `node` on the
# tsc-emitted dist/ — no tsx runtime loader. tsx 4.20+ registers a JSON
# transform on the module loader that rewrites `*.json` into ESM JS, which
# breaks any CJS dependency doing `require('./*.json')` (notably
# `cli-boxes` via `boxen` via `ink`). Compiling ahead of time and dropping
# tsx at runtime removes that hazard entirely.
